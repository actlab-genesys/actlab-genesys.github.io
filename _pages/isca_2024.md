# Overview
This tutorial will present a discussion on emerging deep learning models along with a comprehensive walkthrough of our newly developed system, _GeneSys_.
Attendees will gain valuable insights into our cutting-edge technology and its wide-ranging applications in the field of DNN acceleration systems.

# Goals
We aim for attendees to gain a thorough understanding of the functionalities of our innovative system.
They will learn how it can be effectively implemented in various applications and be equipped with the knowledge to harness its potential for their own projects and research in deep learning and DNN acceleration systems.

# Who Should Attend
Researchers and developers interested in deep learning systems, compiler development, and hardware/software design for DNN acceleration systems.
